# 👋 Hi, I’m @Gibur13

- 👀 I’m interested in PCB/board design, ASIC and FPGA development, embedded systems, and computer architecture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced digital ASIC design, RTL verification, and real-time ML deployment on microcontrollers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hardware-centric projects—especially those involving system design, RTL implementation, or mixed-signal integration.
